 1. Implementation

 Student Module 

Users can register by providing their name, email, contact details, and area of interest. Upon successful registration, a notification email is sent with a welcome message, login details, and a link to the login page. Graduates can upload their CVs, which will be used to match them with relevant job opportunities. Students can also create articles that can be marked as public or private, fostering community engagement and knowledge sharing.

 Job Search Module 

This module serves as the core job search functionality. Graduates can view available job listings tailored to their CVs. Once a job is filled, it is removed from the available jobs list. The implementation includes cloud servers, APIs, SQL queries, and basic machine learning algorithms to enhance job matching. The system focuses on key elements that employers look for in CVs to optimize job search results.

Social Life Module 

Graduates can discover and connect with friends who share similar interests. They can engage in private conversations with peers who match their interests. Users can also choose the visibility of their posts, allowing them to share with friends or the broader community.
